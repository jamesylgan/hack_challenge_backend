Backend by Samuel Han (sh779) and James Gan (jg893) 

We really struggled to deploy on time because of Windows issues. Because of that, we were unable to properly test (although we believe that our code is correct but slightly unfinished) and could not deploy in time. Our iOS team wanted to finish by 5PM so we submitted before resolving it fully - but will update Ilan and Young if we get it working after we submit.

Hotels queries use Google Places API with the help of the Google Geocode API to list hotels within 10km for the app to use. The same function can be used for queries of nearby attractions with addresses.

We (wanted) to store hotel queries in our DB to lower the costs of using Google API, and speed up queries, but could not get around to testing that.

We store user data in a DB with a full rest API for user data and users.
